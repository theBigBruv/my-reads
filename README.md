# MyReads Project

This is a simple React bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* install additional packages with `npm install --save sortBy react-router-dom`
* start the development server with `npm start`, after which you will be able to access the app on your browser via http://localhost:3000/

    ├── index.css # Global styles. You probably won't need to change anything here.
    └── index.js # This has been modified to use browser router to move between the "/" and "/search" pages
```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.


## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
